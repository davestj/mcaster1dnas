Mcaster1DNAS 2.5.0 - README
=====================================================================

Mcaster1DNAS is a streaming media server which currently supports Ogg
Vorbis, Opus, MP3, AAC, FLAC, and other audio formats. It can be used
to create an Internet radio station or a privately running jukebox and
many things in between. It is very versatile in that new formats can be
added relatively easily and supports open standards for communication
and interaction.

Based on Icecast-KH by Karl Heyes, Mcaster1DNAS extends the original
Icecast2 with advanced features, modern UI, and enhanced functionality.

Mcaster1DNAS is distributed under the GNU GPL, version 2. A copy of
this license is included with this software in the COPYING file.

Prerequisites
=====================================================================
Mcaster1DNAS requires the following packages:

Required:
* libxml2 >= 2.7 - http://xmlsoft.org/downloads.html
* libxslt >= 1.1 - http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/downloads.html
* curl >= 7.10 - http://curl.haxx.se/download.html
  NOTE: Mcaster1DNAS may be compiled without curl, however this will
        disable all Directory server interaction (YP).
* ogg/vorbis >= 1.0 - http://www.vorbis.com/files

Optional:
* libyaml >= 0.1.7 - YAML configuration support
  Debian/Ubuntu: apt-get install libyaml-dev
  RHEL/CentOS:   yum install libyaml-devel

* OpenSSL >= 1.0 - HTTPS/SSL support
  Most Linux distributions include OpenSSL by default

A Note About Package Management
=====================================================================
If your operating system uses package managers (apt, yum, dnf, etc.):

You will need to install the "development" or "devel" packages for
each prerequisite in addition to the normal packages.

Example on Debian/Ubuntu:
  sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev \
                       libvorbis-dev libyaml-dev libssl-dev

Example on RHEL/CentOS:
  sudo yum install libxml2-devel libxslt-devel curl-devel \
                   libvorbis-devel libyaml-devel openssl-devel

Build/Install
=====================================================================
To build Mcaster1DNAS on a Unix platform:

Standard Build:
   ./autogen.sh
   ./configure
   make
   make install

Build with YAML and SSL support (recommended):
   ./autogen.sh
   ./configure --with-yaml --with-openssl
   make
   make install

Build with custom prefix:
   ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mcaster1dnas \
               --with-yaml --with-openssl
   make
   make install

Configure Options:
  --with-yaml       Enable YAML configuration support (requires libyaml)
  --with-openssl    Enable SSL/HTTPS support (requires OpenSSL)
  --prefix=PATH     Installation directory (default: /usr/local)

Configuration
=====================================================================

Sample configuration files are installed in:
  - /usr/local/etc/mcaster1.xml (XML format - traditional)
  - /usr/local/share/mcaster1/ (YAML templates)

YAML Templates Provided:
  - mcaster1.yaml.in               - Comprehensive template (recommended)
  - mcaster1_minimal.yaml.in       - Minimal configuration
  - mcaster1_shoutcast_compat.yaml.in - Shoutcast DSP compatibility
  - mcaster1_advanced.yaml.in      - All advanced features

Starting the Server:

With XML config:
   mcaster1 -c /etc/mcaster1.xml

With YAML config:
   mcaster1 -c /etc/mcaster1.yaml

The server automatically detects whether your config is XML or YAML!

YP Directory Logging (NEW):

To enable YP connection logging for debugging directory listing issues:

YAML format:
   directories:
     - yp-url: "http://dir.example.com/yp"
       yp-logfile: "/var/log/mcaster1/yp.log"

XML format:
   <directory>
       <yp-url>http://dir.example.com/yp</yp-url>
       <yp-logfile>/var/log/mcaster1/yp.log</yp-logfile>
   </directory>

Admin Interface
=====================================================================
Access the web admin interface at:
   http://your-server:port/admin/

Default credentials (CHANGE THESE!):
   Username: admin
   Password: hackme

Features:
   - Real-time statistics dashboard
   - Mount point management
   - Listener management
   - Relay configuration
   - Tabbed log viewer (Access, Error, Playlist, YP)
   - Modern UI with live updates

Quick Start Guide
=====================================================================

1. Install Prerequisites:
   apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev \
                   libvorbis-dev libyaml-dev libssl-dev

2. Build and Install:
   ./autogen.sh
   ./configure --with-yaml --with-openssl
   make
   sudo make install

3. Copy Configuration Template:
   cp conf/mcaster1.yaml.in /etc/mcaster1.yaml

4. Edit Configuration:
   vi /etc/mcaster1.yaml
   # Set hostname, passwords, ports, etc.

5. Create Log Directory:
   mkdir -p /var/log/mcaster1
   chown mcaster1:mcaster1 /var/log/mcaster1

6. Start Server:
   mcaster1 -c /etc/mcaster1.yaml

7. Test in Browser:
   http://your-server:8000/status.xsl

8. Access Admin:
   http://your-server:8000/admin/

Security Notes
=====================================================================

IMPORTANT SECURITY STEPS:

1. Change ALL default passwords in your configuration:
   - admin-password
   - source-password
   - relay-password

2. Use HTTPS for admin interface (configure SSL certificate)

3. Restrict admin access by IP if possible

4. Keep your server and dependencies updated

5. Review and customize authentication settings

6. Consider running server as non-root user (recommended)

7. Enable firewall rules to limit access

Performance Tips
=====================================================================

For high-traffic servers:

1. Increase system limits:
   - File descriptors (ulimit -n)
   - TCP buffer sizes

2. Configure appropriate worker count:
   workers: 2-4 (based on CPU cores)

3. Adjust queue and burst sizes:
   queue-size: 524288
   burst-size: 65536

4. Enable bandwidth limiting per mount if needed

5. Monitor logs for performance issues

6. Consider using a CDN for high listener counts
