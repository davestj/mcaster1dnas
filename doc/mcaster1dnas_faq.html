<h2>General Questions</h2>
<h4>What is Mcaster1?</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
<p>
Mcaster1, the project, is a collection of programs and libraries for
streaming audio over the Internet. This includes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>mcaster1, a program that streams audio data to listeners</li>
<li>libshout, a library for communicating with Mcaster1 servers</li>
<li>IceS, a program that sends audio data to Mcaster1 servers</li>
</ul>
A source client is an external program which is responsible for sending content data to mcaster1.  Some source clients that support mcaster1dnas are Oddcast, ices2, ices0.3, and DarkIce.
</div>

<h4>What is mcaster1, the program?</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
<p>
mcaster1 streams audio to listeners, and is compatible with Nullsoft`s Shoutcast.
</p>
</div>
<h4>What is libshout ?</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
<p>
	From the README:
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	libshout is a library for communicating with and sending data to an mcaster1 server.
	It handles the socket connection, the timing of the data, and prevents bad data from getting to the mcaster1 server.
	</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<h4>What is IceS?</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
<p>
	IceS is a program that sends audio data to an mcaster1 server to broadcast to clients.
	IceS can either read audio data from disk,
	such as from Ogg Vorbis files, or sample live audio from a sound card and encode it on the fly.
</p>
</div>

<h4>How can I view the stream status page?</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
		<p>
			Check your mcaster1 configuration file for an element
			called &lt;webroot&gt;. This directory contains web stuff.
			In it, place a file called "status.xsl" that
			transforms an <acronym>XML</acronym> file containing stream
			data into a web page
			(either <acronym>XHTML</acronym> or <acronym>HTML</acronym>).
		</p>
		<p>
			There are sample <acronym>XSL</acronym> stylesheets available
			in mcaster1/web/ in the CVS distribution
			of mcaster1.
		</p>

		<p>
			In addition, the web directory can
			hold multiple status transforms, if you can't decide which
			one you want.
		</p>
</div>

<h4>What can I use to listen to an Mcaster1 stream?</h4>
<div class="indentedbox">
		<p>
			We maintain a list of Mcaster1-compatible audio players at
			http://www.mcaster1.org/
